Hello this is a secret message:
There are pages in the old notebook that don’t exist until you’ve already read them. 
Flip back, and the ink is gone. 
Flip forward, and your handwriting is waiting.

Sometimes, the sentences end in words you haven’t spoken yet. 
And sometimes, they end in names you swore you’d forgotten.
