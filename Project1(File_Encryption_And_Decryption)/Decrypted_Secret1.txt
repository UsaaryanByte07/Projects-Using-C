Hello this is a Secret Messsge.
They said the room had no doors, yet the dust on the floor told stories of footsteps coming and going. 
Every night at the same hour, the air grew colder, as if something unseen slipped past the cracks.

I tried waiting once, but the silence pressed against my chest until I could no longer breathe. 
When I left, the mirror was turned slightlyâ€”though I had never touched it.
